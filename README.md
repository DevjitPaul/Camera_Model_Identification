# Camera_Model_Identification
The project titled Camera Model Identification focuses on accurately determining the source camera model used to capture a given image. The primary objective is to trace the origin of digital images by analyzing inherent device-specific features embedded during the image acquisition process. This technique plays a crucial role in digital forensics, copyright protection, and verifying the authenticity of multimedia content. The system is developed entirely using MATLAB, leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to extract and classify camera-specific patterns. The model demonstrates a high degree of reliability, achieving an accuracy range of 95â€“96%, which reflects its effectiveness in correctly identifying the source camera model with minimal error.
